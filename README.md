# Programmers Unknown Battlegrounds (PUBG) - DAJ

Team: Team Dyas

## Things to consider:
- Participants are **not allowed** to bring pre-existing or ready-made projects. All work must be initiated and developed during the hackathon. (We will regularly check the codebase.)
- If any irregularities are found during the checking, it will lead to the team's **disqualification**.
- Participants are encouraged to collaborate **not only within their teams** but also with mentors and organizers for guidance.
- Every team must make at least **three commits every 6 hours** on the given repository.
- All the code must be pushed to the given repository.
- **Only make useful commits.** Do not make random or unnecessary commits. Commits should be meaningful and relevant.
- **First Commit:** One commit is already done by DAJ while creating the repository. Your first commit should be made after the event has started, with the message: `first commit: [commit message]`.
- **Last Commit:** Do the final commit after the event is completed with the message: `last commit: [commit message]`.
- Any team who commits after the **last commit tag** will be **disqualified**.
- After the **last commit**, you are allowed to commit **only once** to upload your presentation to the repository with the message: `upload presentation`.

## Code Quality and Documentation:
- All code must be **well-documented**. Use meaningful comments to explain the purpose of functions, algorithms, and critical sections of the code.
- Follow **best practices** for code structure, naming conventions, and readability.
- Avoid **code duplication**. Write clean and maintainable code.
- Ensure that your code follows standard coding guidelines for your chosen language and framework.

## Team Conduct and Behavior:
- Teams must behave **respectfully** towards all participants, mentors, and organizers.
- Any form of **harassment**, **discrimination**, or **inappropriate behavior** will lead to immediate disqualification.
- Teams should collaborate effectively, ensuring each member contributes positively to the project.
- Professionalism is expected in all communications during the event.

## Mentor Assistance:
- Mentors will be available to provide **guidance** and **advice** on technical issues, debugging, and project development.
- **Mentors are not allowed to code on behalf of any team** or make decisions for the team.
- Teams can ask for advice on **best practices**, **problem-solving techniques**, or **design decisions**, but they must develop the project independently.

## Submission Guidelines:
- Submit your final project by uploading the presentation and project files to the repository.
- Include a **README** file explaining the project, its features, and how to run it.
- Your final commit should include any **demo materials** or additional files required for judges to evaluate your project.
- Ensure all documentation is complete and the project is functional before submitting.

## Judging Criteria:
Will be informed before the event.
